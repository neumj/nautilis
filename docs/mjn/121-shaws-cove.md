Shaw's Cove Roller Coaster

Beach dive at Shaw's Cove during a high tide. Intent was to dive the crevasse's at the west side of the cove. Breaking waves on the crevasses created strong surge and push/ pull through the narrow canyons. Typical beach dive that took a lot of energy to reach the actual dive spot. Fun rise through the canyons, at one point cresting a sill and then sucked down the face to the deepest point on the dive. Typical fauna. Some very large lobsters.
