# Dive 126: Sea Fan Grotto, Catalina, CA, USA
#### Date: 17 March 2024
#### Latitude: 33°26'31.8"N 
#### Longitude: 118°28'19.5"W 
#### Dive Number: 126
#### Overview
##### Type: Ocean, Boat Dive (Makai Mist)
##### Partner: Tobias N.

Low pressure hose on my octo failed right before entering the water. I had swapped the hose onto my rig after Tobias had noted a slight leak from the hose when it was on his regulator the night before. Yikes. Removed my octo, plugged the port and dove with no back-up second stage.

Great dive, worked our way west from in front of the small beach toward Blue Cavern. Nice, thick kelp forest, rocky bottom, grading to sand in 20+ meters. In the kelp forest at 15 meters depth we spot a School shark one row of kelp away! Beautiful shark, approximately 6 feet in length. Shark was as surprised to see us, continued west for approximately 15 meters before going deeper into the kelp and turning around to investigate us. We hung motionless as the sleek creature circled us twice before heading north into the depths. Approximately half way through the dive we are inundated by a mixed school/ flood of fish. Then appears what appears to be another School Shark, clearly causing a panic among the fish population and driving them to shore. We see another (maybe the same) shark later in the dive. Rare, beautiful opportunity and encounter. Excellent dive with many fish and beautiful ecology and geology. Fortunate for this experience together.
